## APSCA

Just me learning how to use git and github, here is all my labs and projects from my AP Computer Science A class.

## After AP Test Reflection

I have taken the AP test, and have learned a lot this year. I am excited to see what projects are ahead of me, and plan to take my learning much further this summer in preperation for Independent study and CyberSecurity Classes next year. If anyone reading this is looking into taking APCSA, I would reccomend it. It is possible for anyone to learn if you put forth an effort.

## Tips For new APCSA Students

- Learn Git and Github, Learning to use git to create this helped me keep track of my work, and work from multiple computers. There is no reason not to learn git if you plan to continue in computer science as it is a helpful tool that is used across the career.
- Come up with your own projects, One thing i regret this year is not pushing myself harder. To be honest, I never struggled too hard with this class, and i think i used that as an excuse to relax. I only made one simple website but i wish i tried harder and learned more about computer science.
