## APSCA

Just me learning how to use git and github, here is all my labs and projects from my AP Computer Science A class.

## After AP Test Reflection

I have taken the AP test, and have learned a lot this year. I am excited to see what projects are ahead of me, and plan to take my learning much further this summer in preperation for Independent study and CyberSecurity Classes next year. If anyone reading this is looking into taking APCSA, I would reccomend it. It is possible for anyone to learn if you put forth an effort.
